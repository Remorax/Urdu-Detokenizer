# Urdu-Detokenizer

This repository contains a script for trivially detokenizing an Urdu corpus. It may also be applied to other RTL languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Pashto, Sindhi etc.), especially as there is not much language dependency, but it has not been tested for the same.

## How to Run

Run `python3 detokenize_urdu.py <path_to_input_corpus> <path_to_output_corpus>`
